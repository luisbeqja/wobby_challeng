# Product Eng Challenge:

**Dynamic FAQ Generator**

### ðŸš€ **Context**

At Wobby, we frequently have conversations with prospects and customers, leading to valuable recurring questions. We aim to capture and prioritize these frequently asked questions (FAQs) quickly and effectively, to enhance our product, messaging, and customer support.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Your Challenge**

Build a straightforward prototype that automatically extracts and ranks the most common questions from conversation transcripts, providing actionable insights into customer inquiries and interests.

### âœ… **Requirements**

- **Input Handling:** Enable users to paste conversation text directly or upload PDFs containing transcripts.
- **Question Extraction:** Automatically identify and extract individual questions from the provided content.
- **Question Grouping:** Unify similar or repeated questions so they can be grouped and counted together, avoiding duplicates.
- **FAQ Leaderboard:** Clearly rank and display grouped questions based on frequency, highlighting the most frequently asked questions.
- **Categorize questions**: Provide a basic categorization or thematic grouping of questions to surface insights on common topics or themes.
- **User Experience:** Develop an intuitive, minimalistic interface that delivers clear, immediate insights.

### âœ¨ **Optional Enhancements** (Bonus)

- Provide a low fidelity mock-up of how integration with transcription services like Fireflies could be accomplished.

### ðŸ“¦ **Deliverables**

- Your codebase / prototype (using TypeScript, Python, or built on a low-code platform).
- A concise explanation (written) outlining your approach, key decisions, and demonstrating your solution.
- A video demo where you explain the project.
